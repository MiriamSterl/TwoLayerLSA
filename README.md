Code used to produce the figures in the paper "The joint effects of planetary $\beta$, topography and friction on baroclinic instability in a two-layer QG model" by Sterl et al. (2025), submitted to Journal of Fluid Mechanics.

In `linear_stability_analysis.ipynb`, all the figures in the manuscript are made. The calculations for creating Figures 3-5 are done in the file `theory_nonzonal.py`.
